## About

Dotfyle is a community site for Neovim users to discover plugins and share dotfiles. Dotfyle maintains an index of 900+ Neovim plugins. You can upload your configuration and it automatically detects which plugins you're using, and syncs this on a daily basis. This enables us to detect trending and popular plugins based on actual usage.

[This Week in Neovim](https://dotfyle.com/this-week-in-neovim) can be found on Dotfyle, a weekly newsletter about news from Neovim core and the plugin ecosystem.
